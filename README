For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

It is important that the file Sources_DB.lib is in the same directory from where you run the programm. This file is the database of the sources and the format is the following:
   First line: integer with the number of sources to read
   then for each source:
      name of the source and number of gammas
      gammas energies
      gammas intensities
      gammas intensities errors

In the folder there is a file named "puls.dat" for test reasons.

Run the programm, choose the source measured, press "open data file" and give the file with the data (for example puls.dat), set Activity, Activity error and measurement time and press "calculate efficiencies".
Following select the function to fit and press "fit".
