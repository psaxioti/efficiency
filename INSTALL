For Linux you can try to run the script eff_install

If that doesn't work run the following commands
# qmake -project
# qmake
Add at the Makefile that is created the flag "-ffloat-store" at the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS variables and the flags "-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm" at the LIBS variable.
Then run
#make
Finally run the executable that is created.
